# TEMP-DELETE

## The Project:
Deleting temporary files on Windows. These files can be found by doing so:  
         * Use `Win + R` for Run Commands.  
         * Type ***temp*** or ***%temp%*** to show the folders (*these both are totally different and show different temp files*).  
         * You can delete manually these files, but this is why this script is for: deleting them automatically!

    * Forking the project using **Fork** in the top right corner.
